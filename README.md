Here, I documented all I learnt and practiced during my course at SkilHarvest_Bootcamp.
## Project Overview
Using the Skilharvest_Stationary_Supplies dataset provides a comprehensive record of sales data for stationary supplies over the period of 2014 to 2015. This dataset offers valuable insights into the purchasing patterns, trends, and performance of stationary supplies within this timeframe. Analyzing this data can allow us to gather insights that enable compelling storytelling, understand the best performance metrics, and assist businesses in the stationary supplies industry, retailers, and analysts in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing initiatives.
